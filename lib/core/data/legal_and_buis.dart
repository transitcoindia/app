Sharing with Our Business Partners
We share your information with third-party business partners for their own marketing purposes. These third parties may include online advertisers or ad tech companies, who provide you with targeted advertising and marketing communications, where permitted by law. The information we share may include details collected through your use of our Services (e.g., information about your bookings and reservations for transit options, including buses, trains, or ride-sharing services) and information gathered through cookies and similar technologies (e.g., your search history, preferred travel routes, price ranges, and the number of passengers).
For example, if you frequently search for train routes between two cities during weekends, we may share that data with transit partners to help them offer you tailored promotions or discounts for those routes.

Sharing with Social Networking Services
Our Services may allow you to connect and share your actions, comments, content, and information publicly or with friends via third-party platforms. For instance, you may choose to share your trip itinerary or route suggestions through social media. However, please be mindful of your personal privacy needs and those of others when deciding what to share. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with third-party platforms, so we encourage you to review their privacy policies.
Sharing to Process Payment Information
To use certain features of our Services (like booking a transit ticket or reserving a ride), we may require payment information. When you submit payment details through our Services, we share that data with third-party payment processors and service providers to fulfill your transaction securely. This may include vendors who provide fraud detection services to protect against unauthorized activity.
For example:
When you use a credit or debit card to book a bus or train ticket, we transmit your card details to the relevant transit provider to process the payment.
You can choose to save your payment information to your account for faster future bookings. If you decide not to save it, your card details will be deleted after the transaction is complete.

Sharing with Other Service Providers
We work with third-party vendors, consultants, and service providers who assist us in operating our Services, performing analytics, delivering marketing messages, processing payments, and preventing fraud. These third parties are only authorized to use your information as necessary to provide these services, and we require them to implement security measures to safeguard your data.
By carefully selecting trusted partners and implementing robust security practices, we strive to protect your information while enhancing your experience with our Services.

HOW WE WORK?
 
Introduction
Transit makes travel planning effortless by scanning hundreds of travel sites in seconds, bringing you the best deals on flights, hotels, rental cars, and more — all in one place. We help you compare prices, explore options, and decide where to book, whether it's directly through an airline or hotel, or via another travel platform.
We don’t charge any extra fees for using our service. Instead, travel providers pay us when you book through their platform or when you click on an offer. This allows us to keep Transit free for you.

It’s important to note that Transit is not a travel agency. We don’t sell tickets, handle reservations, or process payments. When you choose an option, we redirect you to the provider’s website to complete the booking. Always review the provider’s terms and conditions to make sure everything fits your travel needs.
Prices on the website
Transit scans prices across our partnered travel, airline, hotel, and rental car websites to bring you the best options available. We work hard to provide accurate and up-to-date pricing, but occasional discrepancies may occur. This can happen if a partner site hasn’t updated its inventory in real time, there’s a temporary connection issue, or another traveler books a deal right before you do.

To ensure a fast experience, we sometimes cache results — so if two users search for the same trip around the same time, they might see identical results. Our partners typically refresh their listings at least once every 24 hours, but availability can change quickly.

While we collaborate with a wide range of travel providers, we don’t display results from every site. In some cases, we may exclude certain providers due to technical reasons, business decisions, or to maintain a high standard of customer satisfaction.
Reviews and Recommendations

Reviews on Transit come from multiple sources, including feedback collected directly from our users and reviews from our partnered travel websites. We ensure that reviews are genuine, relevant, and help travelers make informed decisions.

For Flights and Car Rentals, we gather reviews from users with confirmed bookings through Transit. For Stays, we display a mix of user reviews and reviews shared by our partners. Customers who have an account with us and opt to receive emails are invited to leave a review after their reservation is complete — ensuring that feedback is based on real, first-hand experiences.

For Flights and Cars, users rate their experience from “poor” to “excellent,” which we convert into a score out of 10. For Stays, scores are averaged from both our collected reviews and those from partner sites. This system helps travelers easily compare options and make confident decisions.

All reviews pass through automated profanity filters. We won’t publish or will remove reviews that violate our guidelines, including content that contains:
Illegal activities or harmful content
Personal or sensitive information
Offensive language, hate speech, discrimination, or threats
Impersonation or false claims
Irrelevant comments (e.g., booking issues instead of travel experience)
Spam or fake reviews
To keep reviews relevant, we may remove those older than three years or if significant changes occur, like ownership changes or major renovations.
We also encourage users to share travel tips! Tips are automatically reviewed and only published if deemed helpful to the community.

If content is flagged or found to violate our guidelines, it will be manually reviewed by our moderation team. In cases where content is removed, users may be notified of the reason, and if applicable, they’ll have the right to appeal the decision. Repeated misuse of the review system or submission of unfounded complaints may result in warnings or, in rare cases, temporary suspension after prior notice.

Our goal is to create a space where travelers can share honest feedback, discover valuable insights, and plan their journeys with confidence.

TRANSIT
Terms & Conditions:
 
Who are we?
Please read these terms and conditions of use carefully before accessing, using, or obtaining any materials, information, products, or services. By accessing the Transit website, mobile or tablet application, or any other feature or platform operated by Shankh Technologies Pvt. Ltd. (collectively, "Our Platform"), you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions ("Terms") and our Privacy Policy. If you do not accept all of these Terms, you may not use Our Platform. In these Terms, "we", "us", "our", and "Transit" refers to Shankh Technologies Pvt. Ltd., and "you" and "your" refers to you, the user of Our Platform.

THESE TERMS INCLUDE AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE LAWSUIT.

We may modify these Terms for any reason — at any time — by posting a new version on Our Platform; these changes do not affect rights and obligations that arose prior to such changes. Your continued use of Our Platform following the posting of modified Terms will be subject to the Terms in effect at the time of your use. Please review these Terms periodically for changes. If you object to any provision of these Terms, any subsequent modifications, or become dissatisfied with Our Platform in any way, your only recourse is to immediately terminate use of Our Platform.

We do not sell travel products.
Transit is a platform designed to help you compare and book travel services like cabs, trains, buses, flights, and hotels. However, Transit doesn’t own, manage, or directly provide these services. The travel options you see are offered by third-party providers ("Service Providers"), such as cab companies, airlines, bus operators, or online travel agencies. These providers are responsible for their services, and their terms and privacy policies will apply to your bookings. Make sure to review those terms carefully, as they govern your travel experience. Any interaction you have with a Service Provider through Transit is at your own discretion, and we can’t be held liable for issues that arise with bookings or during your trip.
The presence of a service or provider on our platform doesn’t mean we endorse them, nor does it imply a partnership or affiliation. We aim to present you with options, but the choice is yours.

Transit aggregates information, including pricing and availability, directly from Service Providers. While we do our best to display up-to-date information, prices and availability can change rapidly. Additional fees (like payment processing fees, baggage charges, or local taxes) might not appear in the initial price, so always double-check the final amount before completing a booking.

In some cases, service prices may be displayed in a currency different from your selected preference. Currency conversions are shown for convenience, but actual rates may vary, and your payment provider might add fees or use a different exchange rate. Always verify the final payment details to avoid surprises.

Intellectual Property
We, along with our affiliated partners, service providers, and licensors, hold ownership over all text, images, software, trademarks, service marks, and other materials on the Transit platform, excluding user-generated content. You may only copy or share this material for personal, non-commercial purposes. Any printed or downloaded materials must retain all copyright, trademark, and proprietary notices.

Names or designations of third-party services, companies, or products displayed on our platform belong to their respective owners and are included for identification purposes only. For detailed information about these designations or their registration status, please contact the appropriate third party. Accessing or using our platform does not grant you any license or rights to use the trademarks or other protected materials found here.

General Provisions
Unauthorized use of our services or platform may cause significant harm to Transit and its affiliated partners, which may not be adequately remedied by monetary damages alone. In such cases, we, along with our affiliates or licensors, reserve the right to seek immediate legal action, including an injunction, in addition to any other remedies available under the law.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the affected provision (or part thereof) will be considered removed, but this will not impact the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions.

These Terms are personal to you, and you may not transfer or assign your rights or obligations to any third party without our prior written consent.

This agreement represents the complete understanding between you and Transit, replacing any prior agreements, discussions, or arrangements regarding your use of our platform or services.
We take breaches of these Terms seriously and will act promptly if we become aware of any violations. If you notice or suspect any unlawful activity, please reach out to our support team.
Failure on our part to enforce any aspect of these Terms does not constitute a waiver of that provision or our right to enforce it later.

Unless otherwise stated, these Terms will be governed by the laws of India. By using our platform, you agree to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in India for the resolution of any disputes.
Limitations & Exclusion Liability
These Terms outline the full extent of Transit’s responsibilities and liabilities in relation to our services and platform.

Transit is not liable for any arrangements made with third-party providers accessed through our platform, including but not limited to cab services, train operators, bus companies, airlines, or hotel providers ("Service Providers"). If you experience any issues with a booking or service, you agree to address the matter directly with the relevant Service Provider, as any refunds, adjustments, or resolutions lie solely with them, not with Transit.
Our platform may include links to third-party websites or resources, provided for your convenience. Transit has no control over the content or availability of these external resources and is not responsible for any loss or damage you may suffer as a result of using them.

You may also encounter third-party advertisements on our platform. Each advertiser is solely responsible for the accuracy and content of its material, and Transit accepts no liability for any errors, omissions, or misleading content within these advertisements.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Transit (along with our directors, employees, affiliates, and partners) disclaims liability for:
Any inaccuracies or incomplete information presented on our platform.
Any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits or savings, arising from your use of or inability to use our platform or services — whether due to system failures, service disruptions, or third-party actions.
Any events beyond our reasonable control, including natural disasters, strikes, or government actions.
Nothing in these Terms will limit or exclude:
Liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
Fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
Any statutory rights that cannot be lawfully excluded or limited.
